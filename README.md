# Settler

This is based very closely (I stole the idea) on an app my friend built when we used to cook together
and each person would buy parts of the food. We would then try to split the bill between us
and had to calculate a lot of things.

He hacked together a Python script that later evolved to a shitty Android app (sorry, but it's true).

I decided to copy it in order to learn ionic.
